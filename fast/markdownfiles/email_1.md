Welcome to the first update from Case, thanks for being a part our first steps! Together, we can do something very special with this platform, and you're on the first ever email update! So, here are the updates.

## Making cases is now open to everyone
Everyone can now make a case! So login, head to [case.science/create](https://case.science/create) and put together your case. 

<a href="https://case.science/create" style="display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; background: linear-gradient(to top right, #fc8181, #9f7aea); color: #fff; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 10px;">Create Your Case</a>

You'll then need to 'add sources' to your case, which should be links to data that support your case. If you have any problems logging in, reply to this email and I'll help. 

## Sources are now clickable

Inside the AI chat view, the AI will quickly explain a source if you click on its title. There's no other interaction required! Just click a source that catches your eye, and the AI will do the rest.

Try it out by [clicking here](https://case.science/case/16) and engaging with Dr Clare Craig's case. Or head to the [front page](https://case.science) and choose a case there.

## Private cases
If you look at [your account](https://case.science/account) you'll see there's now an upgrade option. This paid feature will [very soon] allow you to create private cases. Cases are public by default, but this paid feature allows you to build a case privately first. If you upgrade, you'll be supporting the project hugely!

## Cases are processing much better
It's working well with .pdf files, science paper links, and articles.
Tweets, YouTube videos, and others are all in the pipeline, and as soon as you can add them to cases you'll get an update.

## Spaces on usernames and login via email
If you had a space in your username, it has been removed. This is so your public profile works, which will be available to share at a URL like this:  [case.science/u/DrClareCraig](https://case.science/u/DrClareCraig)

You can check information about your account at [case.science/account](https://case.science/account)

I should add - if you can't remember your username, you can login with your email address.



## Thoughts and feedback welcome
You can reply to this email with thoughts and queries, which are most welcome! If you need help with your idea, give us a shout. 

Hooray,

Phil from [case.science](https://case.science)
